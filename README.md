# leparquet
LeParquet is a tool to calculate amount of parquet boards used to layout in your rooms.

Q: Why? 

A: Because I couldn't find any reasonable tool that gives me sane results which I can use for my flat.

## If you are a normal person

You need to have [swift](https://docs.swift.org) installed. Then just run `swift run leparquet deck --verbose config.yaml`

`config.yaml` should contain you room setup

## If you are a developer

You know what to do.

Hint: `swiftformat . && swift run leparquet deck --verbose config.yaml`

## Taking room measurements

### Door rectangles measurements

### Cutout areas measurements

## Frames and origins

## Layout direction
